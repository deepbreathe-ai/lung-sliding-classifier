Extra files used for ad-hoc data addition (based on supply)

'extra' denotes unprocessed clips ('extras') without metadata that are kept separate from the rest

'more' denotes an additional batch of negative (absent lung sliding) clips, for required preprocessing on these clips only. 
These assume that there are already existing preprocessed clips.

Note that any script in this folder should be moved to data/ before use.
